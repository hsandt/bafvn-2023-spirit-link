    "My eyes widened. That Raegan had heard of Lalahon at all, was surprising. Stories about Lalahon were rare and their contents contraditory. The few that I had heard had been told to me by my grandfather."

    "According to grandfather's tales, Lalahon was either a benevolent goddess born from the ashes of the great, god Bathala's heart, or an evil beast that had killed Bathala and used his fire to destroy the forests."
    "Which version of the tale was true, had been the subject of many debates between the two of us. Only one thing was certain: Lalahon was powerful."
