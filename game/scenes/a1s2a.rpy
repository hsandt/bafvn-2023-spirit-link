    raegan "It's always a pleasure to meet someone who can appreciate the island's unique charm. What drove your interest?"
    show raegan intrigued

    charlet "My ancestors came from the island. Studying at the academia made me realize just how little we, in Enon, know about Moacu. It is my hope that this expedition will help build a bridge between our people and promote appreciation of spirits."

    raegan "Indeed... Pichit mentioned your goal was to catalogue folktales from the island? Did you ever hear any of tales of Lalahon?"

    show charlet intrigued

    "My eyes widened. That Raegan had heard of Lalahon at all, was surprising. Stories about Lalahon were rare and their contents contraditory. The few that I had heard had been told to me by my grandfather."

    "According to grandfather's tales, Lalahon was either a benevolent goddess born from the ashes of the great, god Bathala's heart, or an evil beast that had killed Bathala and used his fire to destroy the forests."
    "Which version of the tale was true, had been the subject of many debates between the two of us. Only one thing was certain: Lalahon was powerful."

    charlet "Only a couple passed down from my grandfather. Much of her history appears lost. I hope that this expedition will allow many more of these tales to be collected and perserved for future generations."
    charlet "Who knows, maybe we'll even discover the secret behind the mist that covered the island!"

    raegan "A worthy endeavour for sure. I look forward to hearing more of your goals and the tourism business proposition."

    charlet "Of course. I have may schedule here would you like to set up time to meet?"

    show pichit intrigued at reset_brightness

    "Before Raegan could respond, a bright flash blinded us. Confused cries sounded out in the crowd and the air grew thick with the scent of smoke."
    "I turned west, watching as smoke poured out from the direction of the alchemy station. Had one of the displays malfunctioned?"

    raegan "My pardons, Pichit... Was a this part of the event?"

    show pichit smile

    "Pichit smiled, nonchalantly waving a hand to dismiss the commotion, but I could see from the tension in his shoulders he was perturbed."

    pichit "Some demonstrations must have malfunctioned. I'm sure it's nothing to be concerned about, sir."

    raegan "Are you sure, that-"

    "A sudden impact steals the rest of his words. A swath of red cuts through the smoke too quick to catch. Belatedly I realize that Pichit has shoved me to the floor."
    "I look up, shocked to find Raegan half-sprawled over the table of my booth, a dark figure standing over him. A glowing shield is the only barrier between his chest and his assailant's knife."

    "A vigilante?!?"

# TODO impact SFX and hit FX

    "Before I can react, Pichit tackles him. The two men go rolling, the pamphlet's I had printed falling with them."

    "For a moment, there is only a mad tangle of limbs. Then Pichit goes flying. The assailant, stands, his knife replaced by a scarf."
    "The incongruity of me strikes me. Why is he balling up a scarf?"

    "..Then my question is answered. Flames ignite. The simple scarf transformed into a firey projectile. I brace myself..."

    "...Only to find myself safe. A wooden shield looms above me."

    "But what was the alternative? If Raegan was hurt, or Garuda-help us, died, what would happen to us?"

    "The proverbial death of both our careers would be the best case scenario. At worse we'd be pegged as accomplices and cast in prision, proof or no proof."

    ragan "A man in my position makes many enemies, Dr.Kasamsun. And there are even more that would kill me just to spite my father."

    "Raegan's expression is dark and his gaze worried. His eyes scan the room, lingering on the boxes stacked against the wall."

    raegan "Are we safe here?"

    charlet "As safe as can be. The univeristy's wards won't allow non-staff into the store rooms. You wouldn't have been able to get in without me."

    "Or my keystone rather. Setting up wards to recognize specific people was impossible."

    raegan "We should contact someone. Do you have a telestone? Can you reach the guard?"

    "I shook my head. The telestone I had was a prototype, courtesy of the charms department. The range was a few hundred meters at best."

    charlet "No. But there should be guards someone where on campus."

    "Focusing, I tried to reach out to Jamil, the head of security. Our conversation was brief and to the point. Unsurprisingly given the chaos, he was being inundated with telecalls."

    charlet "I got someone. They'll be there as soon as they can. Everything will be okay."

    "Or so I hoped. It could be minutes or hours before they came. Worry for Pichit left me deaf to Raegan's reply. Though it was risky, I couldn't help but activate the telestone again, this time reacing out for Pichit..."
